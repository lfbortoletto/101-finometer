# 101-finometer

This tutorial is designed to guide you through the data analysis of the Finometer Model-2, a commercial peripheral vascular monitor developed by Finapres Medical Systems. The Finometer is widely used in both clinical settings and scientific research for non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, measuring beat-to-beat variations. It employs the Modelflow methodology (DOI: 10.1046/j.0001-6772.2003.01211.x) to provide hemodynamic parameters such as stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, and cardiac output.

For more details, please refer to the Finometer User's Guide included in this repository.
